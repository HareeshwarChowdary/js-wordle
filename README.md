# Wordle Clone â€“ A Vanilla JavaScript Project:
A Wordle-style word guessing game built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game recreates the popular puzzle mechanics â€” players guess a 5-letter word in six attempts, with real-time visual feedback for accuracy.
This is a fully functional, responsive clone created as a fun learning project to strengthen front-end development skills and core JavaScript logic handling.

# Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript 

# How it works:
- The game dynamically generates a 6x5 board using JavaScript.
- Players input guesses via keyboard or on-screen keys.
- On submitting a guess:
-ðŸŸ© Green: correct letter in correct position
-ðŸŸ¨ Yellow: letter exists but in the wrong spot
-â¬œ Gray: letter not in the word
- The game ends after 6 incorrect tries or a correct guess.
- Invalid or unrecognized words prompt a "Not in word list" message.

# Things I've mastered with this project:
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Event listeners (keyup, click)
- Responsive design using Flexbox
- Reusable functions and event delegation
- Custom UI styling and class toggling
